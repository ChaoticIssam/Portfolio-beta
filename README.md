# Portfolio-beta
This will be my second attempt on creating a 3D computer graphics in a web browser using Three.Js library. It's still a beta version, there is a lot of things I'm excited to add.
## Features

- **3D Graphics**: Utilizing the Three.js library to render 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Interactive Elements**: Users can interact with the 3D models.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
	```sh
	git clone https://github.com/ChaoticIssam/portfolio-beta.git
	```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
	```sh

## Screenshots
Design I worked on since I'm a beginner in Blender, all I have done is made minor changes on the design.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from my fascination with 3D graphics and web development. I was particularly inspired by a specific open-source project that showcased the capabilities of Three.js and Blender.

Here is some previews on that project and the developer's GitHub account that inspired me:
